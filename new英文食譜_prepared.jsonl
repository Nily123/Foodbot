{"prompt":"pork belly、water spinach、onion ->","completion":" braised pork\n Ingredients:pork belly,water spinach,onion\n Seasonings:chicken powder,soy sauce,white sugar,rice wine,water\n Method:1. Wash the pork belly and cut into long cubes; wash the shallots and water spinach and cut into long pieces. Pork belly cut into long cubes is easier to cook and taste, and it will not break due to prolonged cooking. 2. Put the pork belly cut in step 1 into a hot oil pan, fry over medium heat until the surface is dry and crispy, then remove and drain the oil. The frying temperature is about 130°C. When putting in the meat pieces, it is best to put them along the side of the pot so as not to stick to each other and cause oil explosion. If you don’t want to deep fry, you can directly fry until the outside is dry and crispy. 3. Add sugar and a little water to the frying pan and stir fry over medium heat. You can also add a little hot water directly. The purpose of adding water is to dissolve the sugar faster, so the amount does not need to be too much. Too much will make the sugar color difficult to fry. 4. When the color of the syrup in step 3 turns dark brown, add the meat pieces in step 2 and stir fry evenly, then add all the seasonings and bring to a boil. Stir-fry the sugar color and the meat pieces first, let the meat pieces fully absorb the sugar color, and then add the seasoning, which can make the color of the braised pork more vivid and beautiful. 5. After step 4 is boiled, turn to low heat and simmer for 30 minutes. After it is cooked through, add shallots. The size of the meat will affect the cooking time. The larger the meat, the longer it will take. The cooking time can be increased or decreased according to the situation. 6. Turn the high heat in step 5 to dry up the soup, and then serve it on a plate. Use another pot of boiling water to blanch the water spinach, and take it out as a garnish. Draining the soup can make the taste of the braised pork more concentrated, but if you like more soup, you can also add scallions earlier, and turn off the heat after the onion fragrance is released.
